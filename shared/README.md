**ATTENTION!**

These files were mostly taken from the World of Warcraft Open Source project [Skyfire](https://github.com/ProjectSkyfire/SkyFire.548/tree/master/src/server/shared).

I used this to get a proper base for Networking, Database stuff and logging.
Some files were modified for the usage in the Rappelz Emulator tho.
