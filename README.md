# RZEmulator - An Open Source Rappelz Emulator

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/oelq5cfbeh6iw101/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Xijezu/rzemulator-x6qer/branch/master) 

This project is based on [Project Skyfire](https://github.com/ProjectSkyfire/SkyFire.548), a World of Warcraft emulator.  
We used it to get a proper base for networking & database, see /shared/README.md 

  We tried to keep the code as retail as possible (thanks to various matching .pdb's) and used Pyroks unfinished C# Emulator as a reference.

## Dependencies
* Platform: Linux, Windows or Mac
* MySQL >= 5.6.36 (Windows / Linux)
* A C++14 Compiler

## Current Status
This project is far from finished, but it's a huge base so far. The Emulator is pretty stable so far.
* Most of the non-default skills don't work yet (since they require special interactions)
* Riding (mounts) do not work
* Dungeon Sieges do not work
* Guilds

If you have the possibility, feel free to contribute by reporting bugs or sending in fixes/additions
