# RZEmulator - An Open Source Rappelz Emulator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NGemity/RZEmulator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NGemity/RZEmulator) 
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/8miy91jklmbuxrmb?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/NGemity/rzemulator)

This project is based on [Project Skyfire](https://github.com/ProjectSkyfire/SkyFire.548) & [TrinityCore](https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore), both a World of Warcraft emulator.
We used it to get a proper base for networking & database, see /shared/README.md 

  We tried to keep the code as retail as possible (thanks to various matching .pdb's) and used Pyroks unfinished C# Emulator as a reference.
